# DP/Greedy Type: Matrix Transformation Geometry (In-Place Matrix Flip)
# General Greedy Definition: An algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece 
# by piece, always making the choice that seems best at that exact moment (locally optimal), 
# without worrying about the future impact. It hopes that these local choices lead 
# to a globally optimal solution.

# Time Complexity: O(n^2) -> We traverse the matrix cells a constant number of times.
# Space Complexity: O(1) -> All modifications and swaps happen directly inside the input matrix.
